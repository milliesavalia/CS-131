(*
 * The parse prefix returns a derivation using a curried matcher function that takes in the acceptor that determines
 * what elements to put in the prefix. The matcher looks through all the rules in the given grammar and uses
 * the match_element to compare each element recursively until we find the fragment element in the rules with the 
 * start symbol or ends the prefix, and just returns the suffix along with the derivation that constantly gets 
 * appended to. For more information read the hw2.txt.
